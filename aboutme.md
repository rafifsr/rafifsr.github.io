### My story
- I am an undergraduate student at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, majoring in mechanical engineering and specializing in process systems engineering.
- I come from Indonesia and I have lived in Germany since 2020.
- I have experience working in academia (Chair for Process Systems Engineering @ RWTH) and industry (Process Automation @ Siemens).
- I am finishing my undergraduate studies and writing my Bachelor's thesis at the Chair for Process Systems Engineering at RWTH on optimal stopping for stochastic processes in chemical engineering.
- After finishing my studies at RWTH, I will be attending Purdue University to pursue a Ph.D. in chemical engineering.
- I love to travel, explore the outdoors, and read books. 

### My interests
I find interest in multidisciplinary topics and am always eager to learn. 
- Robotics and automation
- Machine learning in engineering
- Computational modeling and simulation
- Applied mathematics

I'm always open to new opportunities. Feel free to reach out!
